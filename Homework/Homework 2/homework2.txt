Starting at 0x7fffffffe000, we start with the fact that this is a 3 dimensional array. 
We want to get the value at magic8ball[3][4], so we start with index 3. Because it is first index, we start by doing 3 * 8 * 8 = 192.
Then, we get the second value which is at index 4. There, we can do 4 * 8 + 192 = 224.
Converting to hex, we get 0xe0. We add this to the initial address to get 0x7fffffffe0e0. 
The chars stored at that address are: 
0x57 0x72 0x6f 0x6e 0x67 0x00 0x00 0x00

Using the ASCII table, we get
W r o n g nul nul nul

Which outputs:
